# Matching to The Plant List

The reconciliation of a taxonomic name and authority to the plant
list (or other base list) is a common problem in biodiversity
informatics. There are a number of existing solutions to this
([Taxonomic Name Resolution Service](http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/),
[Taxonome](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Taxonome)), but I wanted a
script that did things slightly differently, and in which each of the
matching decision was explicit and editable.  Here is a solution.
